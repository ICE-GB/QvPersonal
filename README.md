# Qv2ray

Qv2ray is a cross-platform Qt frontend for V2Ray.

This repo is personal rewrite of Qv2ray using [Qv2rayBase](https://github.com/moodyhunter/Qv2rayBase), hard forked from `Shadowsocks-NET/Qv2ray`

## Compatibility

This repo contains a whole rewritten Qv2ray Plugin Interface, so no plugins are compatible with the original ones.

The current plugin interface version is `5`.
